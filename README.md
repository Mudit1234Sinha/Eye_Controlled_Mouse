# Eye_Controlled_Mouse

Here I have made an Eye_Controlled_Mouse using which you can control your mouse using the movement of your head and you can,
Imitate the Mouse Click by blinking your Eyes...

Modules I have used are-

1) Cv2 -: OpenCV module 

2) MediaPipe -: MediaPipe is a Framework for building machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data like video, audio.

3) PyAutoGui -:  PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications
